The System XVI Manual
=====================

**A forewarning**: System XVI is not yet useable, not even in a limited
fashion. It remains still prototypical, and will require significant work
before making generally available: completion of basic features, making
robust the code, and creation of tests.
*The manual is made available to the public only under this proviso.*

This is the `System XVI <https://github.com/JX7P/ServiceManager>`_ Manual.
It aims to become an authoritative document on
System XVI, or S16, the new System Resource Manager available for Linux and
BSD.
