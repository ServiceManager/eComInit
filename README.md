# System XVI

![System XVI Logo](doc/logotype.png)

### Overview

**A forewarning**: System XVI is not yet useable, not even in a limited fashion.
It remains still prototypical, and will require significant work before making
generally available: completion of basic features, making robust the code, and
creation of tests.
*The repository is made available to the public only under this proviso.*

System XVI, or S16, is a modern take on service management. It aims to be as or
more functional than its alternatives, while retaining a modular design in the
UNIX tradition.

We have an IRC channel; find it at
[irc.freenode.net #systemxvi](irc://irc.freenode.net/systemxvi). You might also
want to read the System XVI Manual. This is nowhere near complete, but you may
find the work in progress [here](https://system-xvi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

S16 aspires to be both soundly designed and practical: it should be capable of
handling as many use cases as possible, yet achieve this on the basis of its
simplicity and modularity. The twin temptations of under-flexibility and
bloatedness must be avoided.

##### The Four Motives of S16

 * **Interface Orientation**: the system should be designed to fit a clean and
   stable interface. A well-designed interface makes for an obvious
   implementation.
 * **Separation of Concerns**: individual components should not do much alone, but
   work in concert to create a grand system.
 * **Modularity**: components should be easily replaceable and extensible.
 * **Self-healing**: components that crash should be able to restart without
   forgetting system state or otherwise causing breakage.

The Four Motives are a distillation of the factors underpinning the success
of many other systems. From these four motives emerges a naturally clean,
lightweight, and flexible system.

#### Design

System XVI is comprised of several binaries which each do one thing well.

###### Daemons

 * `init` is responsible for *System Initialisation*: it has very few tasks to
    perform, which include reaping processes and starting `s16.restartd`.
 * `s16.configd` is charged with maintaining the *Service Repository*, which
   keeps a record of the state of services, and notifies interested subscribers,
   such as `s16.graphd` when changes to service configuration or state occur.
 * `s16.graphd` is the *Graph Engine*, which creates and maintains a graph of
   services. Using this graph it orders startup, sending requests to
   `s16.restartd` for services to start when their dependencies are satisfied.
 * `s16.restartd` is the *Master Restarter*: its task is to start and keep
   services running in response to requests from `s16.graphd`. If a service
   fails, it notifies `s16.configd` about this.

Some services need different forms of supervision, such as those which are
managed by `inetd`. Rather than bloat its core components with complexity,
System XVI prefers to let other programs handle this. `s16.graphd` entrusts
supervision of these kinds of services to *Delegated Restarters*, such as
`inetd`.

###### Utilities

 * `svccfg` is used to modify entries in the Service Repository. It can read JSON
   files in to import new services, as well as edit the configuration of existing
   services.
 * `svcadm` enables, disables, or restarts a service as requested.
 * `svcs` lists services and their status, with in-depth information available
   on request, such as why a service failed to start.

All these daemons and utilities communicate with each other through a JSON-RPC
interface. The interface is simple and stable; anyone who wants to reimplement a
part of System XVI is welcome to do so. They need only to implement the protocol
that is specified for that part.

### FAQ

> On what platforms is System XVI supported?
 * GNU/Linux
 * MusLibC/BusyBox/Linux
 * All five BSDs (but not as system manager on macOS)

On these platforms all core features should be available. Acting as a system
manager on macOS is nontrivial to implement and out of scope, but as an
auxiliary service manager, it should work.

Any platform which is reasonably UNIX-like and has a KQueue available should
work to a lesser degree. On those platforms, supporting supervision strategies
other than *simple* is not possible. A process tracker driver could be written
for platforms which have some way of keeping track of forking of subprocesses.

> Under what licence is System XVI made available?

System XVI is released under the Common Development and Distribution License
(CDDL) version 1.1 only. You may instead use it under the terms of the GPLv3
if you wish, with the exception of [graph.c](app/graphd/graph.c) (see within
for reasoning.)
